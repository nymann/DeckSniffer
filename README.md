# DeckSniffer
DeckSniffer predicts the remaining cards in your opponents deck, and thereby making it easier for you to play arround key cards.

How does it track played cards?

By iterating through the log generated by Hearthstone it self, so there is no memory reading or anything naughty of that nature.

What decks does it know?

DeckSniffer knows the decks stored in the decks folder as plain text files.

Can I add my own decks?

Yes! Just take a look at one of the already created decks and copy the format.
